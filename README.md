## üåü Featured Projects

### Occolus-AI - Revolutionary Drug Discovery Platform

Occolus-AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and pharmaceutical research. Built using advanced deep learning techniques, this platform predicts drug-protein interactions with remarkable accuracy and speed. The system processes complex molecular structures and provides insights that traditionally would require extensive laboratory research.

**Technical Innovation**: The core of Occolus-AI is a PyTorch-based neural network that processes 1424-dimensional ECFP (Extended Connectivity Fingerprints) molecular representations. This approach allows for comprehensive analysis of molecular properties and their potential interactions with protein targets.

**Real-World Impact**: By achieving sub-second inference times, the platform can rapidly screen thousands of potential drug compounds, significantly accelerating the early stages of drug discovery research.

**Architecture**: Built with a FastAPI backend for high-performance molecular prediction services, integrated with UniProt and PubChem databases for comprehensive compound information, and featuring a Next.js frontend with interactive 2D molecular structure visualization.

**Technologies:** `Python`, `PyTorch`, `Next.js`, `FastAPI`, `RDKit`, `Gemini AI`
