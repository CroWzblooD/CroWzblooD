## üéØ Current Focus & Goals

As I approach the completion of my Computer Science degree, I'm focused on building production-ready applications that can scale to serve millions of users. My current learning path includes advanced system design patterns, cloud-native architecture, and exploring the latest developments in AI/ML technologies.

I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can contribute to large-scale systems that have meaningful social impact. Whether it's optimizing government digital services, building AI-powered solutions for healthcare, or creating platforms that connect people and services, I'm drawn to challenges that combine technical complexity with real-world value.

My immediate goals include securing a full-time software engineering role where I can apply my skills in building scalable systems, contributing to open-source projects that align with my interests in AI and web development, and continuing to mentor aspiring developers in their journey.
